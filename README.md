# sudoku-lens-python

## Overview
This project uses OpenCV and Tesseract-OCR to detect and read a Sudoku board from an image. To solve the board both a heuristic algorithm is used which falls back to a brute force if it is unable to solve the board.

## Requirements
- NumPy - `pip install numpy`
- OpenCV - `pip install opencv-python`
- Tesseract OCR (Version 5+) - https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Home.html
